### HowFar is an activity mapping app that makes mapping runs, hikes, bikes and more a quick and easy process.

## Site
[HowFar.run](https://howfar.run)

## Key Features
- No login required! You don't need to make an account to use HowFar. I don't want your data and I know how annoying it is to be forced to create an account to do something simple like map a run. The only time you will need to login to anything is to post a mapped activity to Strava (more on that later).
- All the mapping features you've come to expect from the other activity mapping tools on the internet. Auto follow roads, edit, undo functionality, clear route, out and back, multiple map views (street, satellite, trails, dark), etc.
- Right click to quickly bypass the auto follow roads feature for smooth transition between following established routes and (for example) hopping curbs, mapping through parks, etc.
- Append route segments to both the beginning and end of the route. Helpful in case you've mapped a complex route and want to edit the start.
- Road/walkway preference for fine-tuning routes.
- Edit your route between 2 waypoints by deleting and re-drawing whole sections in bulk.
- 3D visualization of your routes with cinematic animations showing elevation profiles and terrain.
- Strava integration to post your route as an activity to your Strava account (requires Strava login).
- Import and export activities from/to GPX files
